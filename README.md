TODO: Setup the readme with actual information!

Basic Description: This plugin is intended for use with outdated Minecraft servers to enable UUID support in plugins.
This will not add UUID support to player files, mods, or existing plugins; only to plugins who are created with this resource in mind.

All plugin interactions should be done through the UUIDAPI class through the various getName and getUUID methods. Any updates to the cache will be handled automatically by the plugin as necessary.
